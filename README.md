# Carbon Offset Calculator

## Overview
The Carbon Offset Calculator allows users to calculate their carbon footprint based on their home energy usage and transportation habits. It also provides actionable steps for offsetting their carbon emissions.

## Features
- Calculates home energy emissions (electricity and natural gas)
- Calculates transport emissions (car and flight)
- Provides personalized offset recommendations
- User-friendly command-line interface

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/username/carbon-offset-calculator.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd carbon-offset-calculator
    ```
3. Install the required dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage
Run the calculator:
```bash
python carbon_calculator.py
```

Follow the prompts to enter your energy usage and travel data. The calculator will display your total carbon footprint and provide recommendations for offsetting your emissions.

## Future Enhancements
- Add more emission sources (waste, food, etc.)
- Implement a GUI interface
- Add data validation and error handling
- Include more detailed offset recommendations
- Add the ability to track progress over time
- Integrate with external APIs for more accurate calculations
